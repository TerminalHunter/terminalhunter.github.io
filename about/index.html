<!-- PURPOSE SECTION-->
<h3>The Purpose of this Blog</h3>
<div>
Honestly, this blog is still in development and this part in particular is nowhere close to being set in stone. But if I had to lay out some goals, here's what they'd be:
<ol>
<li>Explore practical game design tenets and philosophies in a review format
<li>Dive deeply into game mechanics and provide comprehensive reviews of a game's systems
<li>Develop various theories in game design, e.g. find more and refine the aesthetics of MDA theory 
<li>Compel myself to write more and keep a personal listing of thoughts/opinions on the games I play
</ol>
</div>
<!-- THE RATING SYSTEM SECTION-->
<h3>The Rating System</h3>
<div>
Each video game that is reviewed on this site is given a rating that is very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide">Michelin star system for restaurants</a>, though this site uses widely different criteria that apply to video games.<br>
<br>
All games start at a rating of 0 stars, with a few rare exceptions. A 0 star rating isn't necessarily a bad thing. A 1 star rating on this blog is tantamount to an 8/10 or 9/10 rating on most other sites. Most 0 star ratings will be perfectly playable and fun games that fumble on a few criteria or had a core mechanic or concept that wasn't fully fleshed out or weaker than it needed to be. The first star is, in my opinion of this system, the hardest to earn.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<div class="main-navigation">Criteria for a 1 star rating<br>&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</div> 
<ul><li>The game passes a method of judgement I was taught to use with <a href="http://www.chrysler.org/images/collections/rothko-r.jpg" target="_blank">modern art</a>: What did the artist intend and were they successful? The answer to the second question needs to be: "yes."
<li>Is it effectively priced? The first star is essentially a full recommendation to buy the game.
<li>Does it have at least 1 aesthetic it displays well?
</ul>

For more info on video game aesthetics, please read the next section of this About page... and before you ask, these have nothing to do with visual aesthetics or <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Aesthetic&defid=7883046">that "aesthetic" meme</a> seen in other places on the internet.<br>
<br>

<hr>
<div class="main-navigation">Criteria for a 2 star rating<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</div> 

<ul><li>Does it have at least 2+ aesthetics it displays well?
<li>The game does something interesting, new, or otherwise novel.
<li>The experiential value of the game [DEFINE ME] ludic word salad
</ul>

To bridge the gap between a 1 star rating and a 2 star rating, a game needs to demonstrate a greater and, more importantly, a wider appeal. That game must also demonstrate a significant contribution to the wider medium.<br><br>
<hr>
<div class="main-navigation">Criteria for a 3 star rating<br>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</div>
<ul><li>After at least one year since the game earned its 2 stars, does it still hold up?
</ul> 

The third star denotes it's a game that everyone should play and the game is a classic in every sense of the word. This rating should only be given to games that are well and truly complete.<br>
<br>
<hr>
The above ratings are mutable and games may have their ratings adjusted over time. The creteria for a 3 star review demands that reviews are updated if they meet the standards I put forth. Reviews will be updated in a way that retains all of their previous content, but brings to light the changes that occur in the passage of time. This website will also list the most recent review or update to a previous review first.<br><br> 
There are two other ratings that this site can give a game, but they fall outside of the star system.<br>
<br>
<div class="main-navigation">Classification Pending</div>
This is a game that I intend to review, but have yet to put the time into it or the game is not in enough of a "released" state to warrant a review.
<br><br>
<div class="main-navigation">Classification Refused</div>
This is a rating I do not take very lightly. If this rating were to be given to a game, it means something is fundamentally wrong with the game beyond the standard criterion for judgement. A game with this rating will not be reviewed any further and I recommend against its purchase in the strongest possible terms.<br><br>It's a game only fit for the giftschrank.
<!--
I should come up with a bunch of short quippy ways to describe the various ratings.

0 stars = Maybe try it
1 star  = Buy*
2 stars = Buy
3 stars = I'll buy it for you (if I can)

*If you like this sort of thing/aesthetic, try it if you're not sure<br>

<!-- WHAT ARE VIDEO GAME AESTHETICS SECTION -->
<h3>What Are Video Game Aesthetics?</h3>
<div>
Despite the fact that this site recommends the purchase of any game that earns at least one star, there's a caveat to that recommendation: people tend to like different games for different reasons. Someone can like a game's story while another thinks it is too large of a hinderance to an aspect of the game they like better.
<br><br>
To aid in better matching the game to the gamer this site will dedicate a portion of each review to looking at a game's aesthetics, based off of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDA_framework">the MDA framework</a>. 
<br><br>
For reference, the original paper can be found <a href="https://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf">here</a>.

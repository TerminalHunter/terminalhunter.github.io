<h3>The Rating System</h3>
<div>
Here's where I put <s>shit</s> things.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure I need to write down this classification system somewhere.
<ul>
<li>Classification Refused<br>
	Something is fundamentally wrong with the game beyond the standard criterion for judgement. Will not be reviewed and I recommend against its purchase in the strongest possible terms.</li>
<li>Classification Pending<br>
	Havn't gotten around to it or the game is not in a "released" state yet.</li>
<li>0 stars<br>
	Didn't get 1 star. Probably a perfectly fine game.</li>
<li>1 star<br>
	It has passed the judgement I usually reserve for modern art. What did the artist intend and were they successful? If the answer to the second question is yes, proceed to next point.
	Is it effectively priced? Even just the first star is essentially a recommendation to buy the game.
	Does it have at least 1 aesthetic it displays well? (MDA Theory Aesthetic)</li>
<li>2 stars<br>
	Does something interesting, new, or otherwise novel.
	Does it have at least 2+ aesthetics it displays well? Can't have any one trick ponies here, broader appeal is a must for 2 stars.</li>
<li>3 stars<br>
	Staying power. Only games with 2 stars are eligible and only 1 year after earning their two stars. Does it stand the test of time?</li>
</ul>
I'm probably going to come up with a bunch of short quippy ways of describing the star systems.
<ul>
<li>0 stars = Maybe try it</li>
<li>1 star  = Buy*</li>
<li>2 stars = Buy</li>
<li>3 stars = I'll buy it for you (if I can)</li>
</ul>
*If you like this sort of thing/aesthetic, try it if you're not sure<br>

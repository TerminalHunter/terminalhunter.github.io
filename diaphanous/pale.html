<h1><a href="http://terminalhunter.github.io/diaphanous">A History of Diaphanous</a></h1>
<br><br>
<p>(Roll 11, Infrastructure)<br>
Once upon a time, long after the cataclysm, The Old King stood as the ruler of Diaphanous.<br><br>
(Roll 10, Decline)<br>
His reign was a long and just rule, but as his years increased it seems he faded into demented madness.<br><br>
(Roll 10, Decline)<br>
Succesion came into question and the Royal House was tested, but eventually a suitor was chosen and was about to be seated as King.<br><br>
(Roll 9, Treachery)<br>
Unfortunately, a jealous brother deemed illegitimate personally assassinated the King and assumed rule over Diaphanous.<br><br>
(Roll 10, Decline)<br>
His rule was harsh, as he instilled fear in the population in order to try and bolster his standing and legitimize his throne.<br><br>
(Roll 7, Invasion/Revolt)<br>
His efforts were wasted, however, as the rightful heir to the Assassinated King's throne began to rally the state against the Kinslayer. He brought war to the lands of Diaphanous in order to restore the right to rule to the original royal family.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the True King was killed in the fighting, the last of his house without an heir, but as the Kinslayer was deposed it allowed for a new ruling family to arise.<br><br>
(Roll 16, Glory)<br>
This would be the Pale King's time to shine, and he was chosen out of the rulers eligible because he was a kind yet powerful ruler. Everyone agreed he was the best fit.<br><br>
(Roll 12, Ascent)<br>
His reforms and introduction of the yearly games to the gods cemented his rule and he has ever since been the undisputed King of Diaphanous.<br><br>
(Roll 5, Catastrophe)<br>
However, his rule is to be tested.<br><br>
A Mana Storm, an uncontrollable arcane rift that darkens the skies like a storm yet brings disorder to magic and the natural world hit the kingdom decades ago.<br><br>
(Roll 7, Invasion/Revolt)<br>
This storm severely weakened Diaphanous and, worse yet, allowed for invasion and the spread of lawlessness as the state attempted to recover from the carnage. Only just now has peace returned to the lands, but none know from where the mana storm originated nor if it could be prevented in the future.<br><br>
 
 
But now is a time of peace and rebuilding, as many new houses enter the fray.</p>

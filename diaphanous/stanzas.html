<p>The Stanzas have been a tradition of the Confessor of Ufuoma to host.
<br><br>
This particular game is known for it's complexities, which this author will try to simplify here:
<br><br>
Any number of poets may form a team in order to compete. The first round of the game is a test of the various poetic traditions in the land. Judges will give questions about prose to the competing team and the team must answer all questions to the judge's satisfaction or else be disqualified. 
<br><br>
During the competition, competitors are expected to recite lines of prose in real-time. At least one member in the group will be expected to answer within a certain, short time limit and there can be no confusion as to what is said.
<br><br>
The teams of poets are, each round, assigned to work collaboratively with another team chosen at random. This group of two teams are put up against another group of two teams chosen in the same way. 
<br><br>
After given the style and theme of poem to create by the judge, one group takes turns between the two teams reciting one line at a time. This first poem, known as a "call," must then be responded to/finished by the opposing group with a poem of their own, recited one line at a time in the same manner as the call. This second poem is known as the "response." After the response, the group that made the call swap with the group that made the response and the cycle repeats. This pattern continues until the judge declares a winner.</p>

<h1><a href="http://terminalhunter.github.io/diaphanous">A History of Diaphanous</a></h1>
<p><br><br>
Since the very early years of the Pale King's reign, the capital of Diaphanous hosts a yearly celebration that lasts a week. The event is usually a series of tournaments, games, and feasts that are all based on the theme for that year. Everyone of prominence within the Kingdom is expected to attend, especially the landed nobility, and the more prestigious often patronize their more outstanding subjects by sponsoring and accompanying them to the capital to compete in the games. Anyone is allowed to compete and extravagant prizes are often awarded to the winners. Any subject of standing may suggest a game or tournament to be hosted during the next cycle of games, provided any prize money is held by the Royal House until the game is hosted. As such, there is often hundreds of tournaments and prizes available each year.
<br><br>
There are four themes the yearly events cycle through:
<br><br>
<u>The Grand Martial Tournament and the Pugilistic Games</u>
<br>
The Pugilistic Games are held in honor of Feutentia and Pugidamas. The games are often themed around skill in combat and most games are often a place for different houses to show off the champions of their armed forces. The Royal House and the Pale King themselves host and fund a grand prize for a grand tournament of martial prowess. It's a rather simple affair: a single-elimination tournament, one on one combat with wrapped/dulled weapons until one man yields or is unable to continue. With thousands of competitors, the rest of the festivities tend to end when the final round of the Grand Tournament is finished and a final champion of the realm is announced.
<br><br>
<u>The Statesmen's Fair and the Liturgical Games</u>
<br>
Also known as the Magician's Tournament, the Liturgical Games are held in honor of Feutentia and Legutourgia. The main event of this theme isn't purely a Royal institution and is instead hosted by the Academy of Cardinals and the six Confessors: The Statemen's Fair. It is a showing off of the latest and greatest of the arcane arts and other mental and magical disciplines. It's a rather complex series of magical demonstrations and lectures on the latest magical and technologic treatises. The original intentions of this event was to share discoveries and spread knowledge about the realm, but the vast majority of spectators tend to stick with the more visual magical demonstrations.
<br><br>
<u>The Harvest Festival and the Equestrian Games</u>
<br>
The Equestrian Games are held in honor of Equimor. The games are often themed around agricultural pursuits, but the long standing popularity of the joust demanded it take center stage in what is otherwise a week-long feast and a grand sampling of the fruits of the Kingdom's labor. The Royal House holds a standard joust with a best-of-three runs scored by a panel of judges, but plenty of variations on the rules can be found hosted by other houses. There's also plenty of competitions for best pie, best drink, largest root vegetable, and whatever other commodity an aspiring merchant might want to subsidize.
<br><br>
<u>The Carnival of Old and the Dramatic Games</u>
<br>
Often humorously referred to as the "Forgotten Festival," the Dramatic Games are held in honor of Odalric and Ufuoma. The best way to describe this event is a shopping spree followed by a drunken orgy of pure entertainment. The Royal House takes a break this year: both by leaving the main events up to various trade guilds and by ignoring a majority of taxes leading up to the event. Each guild tends to host a contest to judge the best craft from their specialty. The abundance of disposable income floating around leads to more eclectic events based on the near-random whims of yesteryear, but more structured events can still be found for cultural pursuits: Music competitions, debates, theater, and poetry. All that being said, most of the peasants in the capital just get hammered and stumble into whatever event looks like it suits their fancy. The more temperate citizens often find themselves spectating <a href="stanzas.html">the Stanzas</a>: an elaborate and complicated game where teams of poets take turns under rigid rules and in verse to create collaborative pieces of poetry.

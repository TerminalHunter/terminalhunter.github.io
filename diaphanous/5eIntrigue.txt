Step 4: Choose Your Action
---
Assist.................................... Make a Persuasion check DC 15 and if you succeed you may roll on any tests the assisted takes part in next round, replacing your value with theirs if you wish
Consider.................................. Do nothing, gain advantage next round
Fast Talk................................. Make a Persuasion test against an opponent's Wisdom Saving Throw and if they fail they lose the bonuses to intrigue defense from INT
*Influence*............................... Roll using the skill dictated by your technique, do damage to composure
Manipulate................................ Roll your Deception against their Insight and on success choose their technique next round
Mollify................................... Roll DC 15 Persuasion to heal 1d4+(Persuasion Mod) composure, DC 20 Persuasion to heal 1d6+(Persuasion Mod), and DC 25 for 1d8+(Persuasion Mod)
Quit...................................... Read the tin, gg no re
Read Target............................... Roll Insight against their Deception and if you win get advantage
Roll Initiative........................... Flip a table, draw a weapon, and start a fight
Shield Yourself Behind Your Reputation.... Replace defense with status*6, one turn only, once per intrigue
Withdraw.................................. Replace your defense with the result of a Wisdom saving throw
Torture................................... Don't get too many ideas, but if you do lethal damage and the target is unable to resist, it takes away from intrigue defense. But, STR and CON saving throw bonuses replace the INT bonus in intrigue defense. DC 10 Medicine check to get approx. target HP. DC 15 to resusitate, +5 for each resusitation after the first.

Step 5: Technique
---
If you chose *Influence* in step 4, choose a technique.

Pls no metagaming. This decision should be based on the situation at hand and the flavor of roleplaying, not which skill you're best at.

Any skill may be replaced by Deception using the same base stat.
Sufficient and flavorful reasoning can change any skill's base stat.

Step 6: Doing "Damage"
---
The difference between your defense and the opponent's roll is taken off of your composure.
You can mitigate this by taking 1 point of frustration and rolling a Wisdom saving throw DC 5+(Incoming Composure damage). 
On success, you successfully mitigate and take no composure damage. On failure, you gain disadvantage on the next round of intrigue and take the composure damage.
Each point of frustration lowers your intrigue defense by 1 and is removed once you complete a long rest.

Step 7: Wash, rinse, repeat until someone loses or quits

From wikipedia:<br><br>
Tabletop game is a general term used to refer to board games, card games, dice games, miniatures wargames, tile-based games and other games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface.<br><br>
The term is used to distinguish these types of games from sports and video games. The term is also used to distinguish role-playing games from role-playing video games and LARPs, although role-playing games may not necessarily require a wide playing surface.<br><br>
Here are a few examples of tabletop games I've designed:<br><br>
<a href="/content/samples/TimeChess.pdf" style="text-align:center;font-size:36pt;text-decoration:underline;">Time Chess</a><br>
A forth-dimensional spin on the classic game of chess. The basic premise of the game is: how would chess be different if your pieces were allowed to travel through time?

<a href="/content/samples/ByTheSeatOfYourPants.pdf" style="text-align:center;font-size:36pt;text-decoration:underline;">By The Seat of Your Pants</a><br>
A generalized, rules-light tabletop roleplaying game for those new to genre.
